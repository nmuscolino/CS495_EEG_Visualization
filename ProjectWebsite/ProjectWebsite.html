            <h2>Project Goals</h2>
            <p>
                The purpose of this project is to create an intuitive system that allows users 
                to visualize the positions of EEG electrodes in 3D space. This system also
                enables users to view the name and coordinate data of each electrode.

            <h2>Tools and Frameworks</h2>
            
            <h3>Scaniverse</h3>
            <p>
                An iOS photogrammetry app that we used for scanning the EEG device and it's 
                electrodes. This app is free to use and exports in point cloud formats.
            </p>

            <h3>Django</h3>
            <p>
                We ended up choosing Django for our web hosting framework as we wanted 
                something that was easy to set up and utilized Python for its API.
            </p>

            <h3>Open3D</h3>
            <p>
                For processing the point cloud data generated from the scans we used the 
                Open3D library. This tool allowed us to downsample and filter the data rather 
                quickly resulting in a functional demo by end of the first sprint.
            </p>

            <h3>Three.js</h3>
            <p>
                The front-end visualization is written using the three.js library. After the 
                point cloud data is processed, the name and position of each electrode are 
                passed to the front-end as a JSON file. Three.js has many high-level functions
                that made it easy to render and manipulate the cluster of electrodes as spheres 
                in 3D space.
            </p>
            <h3>AWS</h3>
            <p>
                AWS is used to register domain names, host our project website, and deploy 
                application to the web. We wanted to use this cloud service because it is 
                widely used in industry.
            </p>
            <h3>Docker</h3>
            <p>
                Docker is used to containerize our application to reduce comlications in 
                deployment. This service was chosen as it is the industry standard for 
                containers.
            </p>
            <h3>Apache</h3>
            <p>
                Apache is used as the production web server. This was chosen because it is 
                more robust than the test server built into Django.

            <h2>User Experience</h2>
            <p id="block">
                Our goal is to make the entire user experience as fluid and intuitive as possible. 
                First, the EEG subject sits stationary while the scan is being 
                performed. Using the Scaniverse iOS app, the user slowly circles the subject 
                while keeping the camera focused on the EEG cap. After the scan is complete, 
                it begins processing which takes roughly a minute. The data can then be 
                exported in a point cloud format. The file is then uploaded to the 
                database via the front-end upload page. This page can be accessed from a 
                mobile browser in order to avoid the hassle of traditional file transfer 
                methods. Once the data has finished uploading to the database, the file 
                can be selected from the visualization page and rendered as a cluster of 
                spheres. The visualization can be manipulated by panning, zooming, and 
                orbiting the camera. There are also options to reset the camera view and 
                change the camera sensitivity.
