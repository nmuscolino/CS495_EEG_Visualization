After cloning the repository, there are a few steps that need to be taken before it can be used.

The first step is creating an Anaconda environment with python3.
If python3 is not installed, install now with the appropriate package manager. It may take some time to complete this step.
	
  conda create -n djangoenv python=3.10 anaconda // This creates a new anaconda environment called djangoenv which includes Python 3.6	
 
Activate the new environment.
  
  conda activate djangoenv
  
Install Django in the new environment if it is not already installed. Approve any additional installation requests.
  
  conda install -c anaconda django

This should automatically install Django version 4.1.

You should now be able to make migrations with 
	python manage.py migrate
from within the Anaconda environment.

Test that everything is working by running the server 
	python manage.py runserver
Access the website at the following url:
  http://127.0.0.1:8000
	
To allow yourself admin access on the server. Create a superuser
	python manage.py createsuperuser
	
You can use this account to login to /admin on the server.
