Test Procedures

As of Sprint 1, test procedures include uploading a point cloud file to the webpage and viewing the node locations in the generated visualization.

Once this is uploaded, review the Django log to ensure HTTP requests are being sent and received correctly.

The node coordinates are printed to the console under browser developer tools. Check this to ensure coordinates are being obtained correctly.

Check the developer tools console for any JavaScript errors when running the visualization.
